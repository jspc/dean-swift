Dean Swift
==

A simple chrome extension; replaces 'Dean Swift' with 'Hand Shank'. Purely childishness.

Nomenclature and Terminology
--

both **hand shank** and **ham shank** are used commonly. I use **hand shank** purely becuase I have always called it that. Changing this isn't remarkably difficult.
